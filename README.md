# Private-Key-Encryption-and-Decryption
Implemented a secure method for encrypting and decrypting private keys using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode. The project involved deriving a 32-byte encryption key from a user-provided password using SHA-256 and using it to encrypt and decrypt private keys.
